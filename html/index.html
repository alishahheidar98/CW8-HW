        <h2 class="hero__whatTodo">My name is Ali Shahheidar.
            I was born in March 1381 in Ahvaz. Of course,
            we came to Tehran with my family when I was six months old.
            I had a good childhood. Since I was 7 years old, I became very interested in football and played in teams like
            Naft Tehran for several years. A few years later,
            by studying mathematics, I was able to enter the field of mechanical engineering at Sharif University of Technology.
            Of course, due to my interest in computer science, I changed my major to
            computer engineering in this university.</h2>

                <h1>What did I do?</h1>
                <h2>Let's take a look at my honors and achievements</h2>
                <p>If I want to explain to you from the beginning my entry into the real world,
                    I can divide my honors into several categories, which include sports-educational
                    and artistic ones. There is a lot to say in the field of sports, because I am
                    basically an athlete and I have something to say in every branch of it.
                    I have many city and country medals in football. In volleyball, I have the championship title of Tehran. I have the championship title in ping pong in Tehran schools.
                    In the basketball branch, I have two championship and runner-up titles in Tehran schools.
                    In the field of art, there is a lot to say, but the most striking one is the gold medal for wood carving and inlaid work in the whole country,
                    which I won in the seventh, eighth and ninth years of middle school.
                    And we get to education. Honestly, I didn't study much at first and I was looking for other jobs like football. Until one day, we made a deal with one of my friends.
                    Whoever gets a higher grade in math is better than the other,
                    and that's when I started studying. During several years,
                    I won the title of runner-up and third in the city and country competitions in mathematics and physics,
                    and until
                    now I am studying computer engineering at Sharif University.</p>

            <div class="Skills__card">
                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p>I have started programming with this language (Python)
                    for about 3 years and so far I have written 3 important
                    projects with this language, one of which is a program
                    that I wrote for one of my professors in the second semester of my bachelor's
                    degree. What this program does is to confirm each person's presence in the class by entering the student number</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Skills__card">
                <h2>Football</h2>
                <p>Start playing from the seventh. At first,
                    I was not very good, but gradually my game
                    improved until I finally joined the school team.
                    In the sixth grade, we were able to win the championship
                    of Tehran schools. After that, I was able to
                    enter professional teams such as Naft-e Tehran and became
                    the captain of this team for about 2 years and was able to win the title of runner-up in Iran.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Skills__card">
                <h2>Olympiad</h2>
                <p> With the encouragement of my family, I entered the Physics Olympiad.
                    I passed the first stage and didn't continue any more,
                    and then I entered the Mathematical Olympiad. Again, I was accepted in the first stage and did not continue. I
                    was very interested in participating in the Computer Olympiad,
                    but time was lost, and I could not participate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Skills__card">
                <h2>Web Designing</h2>
                <p> have been working with HTML/CSS and JS for about six months,
                    and I am trying to make myself stronger than I am in web design.
                    In the field of programming, I like these languages more than others because I can see the results of my work
                    live and enjoy my work. I have worked with Python, C++, C,
                    JAVA, GO, but none of them give me as much pleasure as HTML/CSS and JS.</p>
